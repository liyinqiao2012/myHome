## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

- **LoRAN: Improved Low-Rank Adaptation by a Non-Linear Transformation, 2023-2024**
  - In this paper, we study parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for large pre-trained models. Specifically, we improve LoRA approaches to alleviate the performance loss from the constrained adapter by introducing a non-linear transformation (call it LoRAN). For a better adaptation, we also design a new non-linear function to appropriately fit the accumulated weight updates. 
  - We test our method in multiple advanced large language models. Experimental results show that our LoRAN significantly outperforms a strong baseline on SAMSum and 20 Newsgroups tasks. Moreover, when a lower rank is applied, our approach even yields a 1.95-point improvement in the classification task. 

- **Learning Reliable Neural Networks with Distributed Architecture Representations, 2020-2022**
  - Most NAS systems are unreliable due to the architecture gap brought by discrete representations of atomic architectures. In this work, we improve the performance and robustness of NAS var narrowing the gap between architecture representations. More specifically, we apply a general contraction mapping to model neural networks with distributed representations (call it ArchDAR). 
  - For a better search result, we present a joint learning approach to integrating distributed representations with advanced architecture search methods. 
  - We implement our ArchDAR in a differentiable architecture search model and test learned architectures on the language modeling task. On the PTB data, it outperforms a strong baseline significantly by 1.8 perplexity scores. Also, the search process with distributed representations is more stable which yields a faster structural convergence when it works with the DARTS model. 

- **AuMLM: An Auto-regressive Training Approach to Masked Language Modeling, 2021-2022**
  - Traditional masked language modeling systems are forced to predict masked words simultaneously. In this work, we enable models to predict masked tokens in order. More specifically, we determine the order of mask learning according to the dependencies among masked words and sequentially produce the masked tokens in an auto-regressive manner (call it AuMLM). 
  - Moreover, we design a coverage-based masking approach to generating more efficient mask strategies for fast training. 
  - We apply our method to BERT and test it on the GLUE tasks. Experimental results show that it yields an average of 1.15 point improvement. 

- **Learning Architectures from an Extended Search Space for Language Modeling, 2019-2020**
  - Neural architecture search has advanced significantly in recent years but most NAS systems restrict search to learning architectures of a recurrent or convolutional cell. In this work, we extend the search space of NAS. In particular, we present a general approach to learning both intra-cell and inter-cell architectures (call it ESS). 
  - For a better search result, we design a joint learning method to perform intra-cell and inter-cell NAS simultaneously. We implement our model in a differentiable architecture search system. 
  - For recurrent neural language modeling, ESS outperforms a strong baseline significantly on the PTB and WikiText data, with a new state-of-the-art on PTB. Moreover, the learned architectures show good transferability to other systems. E.g., they improve state-of-the-art systems on the CoNLL and WNUT NER tasks and CoNLL chunking task, indicating a promising line of research on large-scale pre-learned architectures. 

- **Sharing Attention Weights for Fast Transformer, 2018-2019**
  - Recently, the Transformer machine translation system has shown strong results by stacking attention layers on both the source and target-language sides. But the inference of this model is slow due to the heavy use of dot-product attention in auto-regressive decoding. In this work we speed up Transformer via a fast and lightweight attention model. More specifically, we share attention weights in adjacent layers and enable the efficient re-use of hidden states in a vertical manner. Moreover, the sharing policy can be jointly learned with the MT model.
  - We test our approach on ten WMT and NIST OpenMT tasks. Experimental results show that it yields an average of 1.3X speed-up (with almost no decrease in BLEU) on top of a state-of-the-art implementation that has already adopted a cache for fast inference. Also, our approach obtains a 1.8X speed-up when it works with the AAN model. This is even 16 times faster than the baseline with no use of the attention cache. 

- **Analysis of Data Parallel Methods in Training Neural Language Models via Multiple GPUs, 2017**
  - In order to speed up the process of training neural models, we apply the data parallel method to train them on multiple devices (such as GPUs). However, due to the frequent data transmission between multiple devices, we cannot get the ideal acceleration effect easily. In this work, we analyse the performance of the all-reduce algorithm and the sampling-based gradient update strategy in the data transmission period. 
  - The experiments show the all-reduce algorithm and the sampling-based gradient update strategy can achieve 25% and 41% speedup on NVIDIA TITAN X. Moreover, we also discuss the applicability of the data parallel method and the influence of different hardware device connection modes on transmission speed.
