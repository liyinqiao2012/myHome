<img src="/myHome/asset/pics/myself.jpeg" alt="Myself" width="212"/>

I am **LI Yinqiao (李垠桥/李垠橋/Joey)**, currently a **postdoctoral fellow** at [AI^2 Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/aisquaredlab/home?authuser=0) at the **City University of Hong Kong** under the supervision of Prof. SONG Linqi. 

I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from Northeastern University (CN) under the supervision of Prof. XIAO Tong and Prof. ZHU Jingbo ([NLPLAB](http://team.neu.edu.cn/NEUNLPLab/zh_CN/index.htm)). I also earned my B.S. degree at the [NEU-RTES Lab](http://www.neu-rtes.org/index.php) of Northeastern University (CN). My research primarily focuses on language modeling, neural architecture search for NLP tasks, machine translation, and related areas. Detailed publications can be found [here](/Research). 

Additionally, I am passionate about contributing to our NLP community. I served as chairs for multiple academic conferences before, and currently I am serving as a 2-year term chair of [WiNLP](https://www.winlp.org), aiming to help promote and support ideas and voices of underrepresented groups. More my community activities can be found [here](/CommAct).

## Misc

I love my hometown (Northeast China). I grew up in Anshan and completed my entire education in Shenyang  (~11 years). People there are very warm and friendly — always cheerful and full of positive energy. I'm so grateful for inheriting the Northeastern Chinese spirit that supports me in any situation.

Now, I work in Hong Kong 🇭🇰. This is also an amazing city. Its high diversity, incredible inclusiveness, magnificent urban and natural landscapes — all these unique features make me enjoy living here. Additionally, I'm learning Cantonese and am really happy to receive compliments from local neighbours like "你嘅廣東話而家幾好喎 (Your Cantonese is excellent now)". 

*With best wishes to my parents and everyone I hold close to my heart.* 🤞
