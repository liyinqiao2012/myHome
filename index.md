I am **LI Yinqiao (ÊùéÂû†Ê°•/ÊùéÂû†Ê©ã/Joey)**, currently a **postdoctoral fellow** at [AI^2 Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/aisquaredlab/home?authuser=0) at the **City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK)** under the supervision of Prof. SONG Linqi. 

I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from Northeastern University (CN) under the supervision of Prof. XIAO Tong and Prof. ZHU Jingbo ([NEUNLP Lab](http://team.neu.edu.cn/NEUNLPLab/zh_CN/index.htm)). I also earned my B.S. degree at the [NEU-RTES Lab](http://www.neu-rtes.org/index.php) of Northeastern University (CN). My research primarily focuses on language modeling, neural architecture search for NLP tasks, machine translation, and related areas. Detailed publications can be found [here](/Research). 

Additionally, I am passionate about contributing to our NLP community. I served as chairs for multiple academic conferences before, and currently I am serving as a fixed term chair of [WiNLP](https://www.winlp.org) (ACL-affiliated affinity group), aiming to help promote and support ideas and voices of underrepresented groups. More my community activities can be found [here](/CommAct).

## Misc

I love my hometown (Northeast China). I grew up in Anshan and completed my entire education in Shenyang  (~11 years). People there are very warm and friendly ‚Äî always cheerful and full of positive energy. I'm so grateful for inheriting the Northeastern Chinese spirit that supports me in any situation.

Now, I work in Hong Kong üá≠üá∞. This is also an amazing city. Its high diversity, incredible inclusiveness, magnificent urban and natural landscapes ‚Äî all these unique features make me enjoy living here. Additionally, I'm learning Cantonese. Every time my local neighbors compliment my Cantonese, like "‰Ω†ÂòÖÂª£Êù±Ë©±ËÄåÂÆ∂ÂπæÂ•ΩÂñé (Your Cantonese is excellent now)", it always makes my day!

*With best wishes to my parents and everyone I hold close to my heart.* ü§û
